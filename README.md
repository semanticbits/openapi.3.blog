# Describing APIs with Swagger and OpenAPI 3.0 in an Express Application

## Example Application

This repository contains the sample application demonstrating OpenAPI 3.0 and Swagger UI
to powerfully and easily describe APIs for proper consumption.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `node app.js`
3. Either `curl` against the API or point your browser at the documentation
4. Crtl-C to exit the running application

## Routes

There are two router files: 1) the Documentation Router, and 2) the API Router.

### Documentation Router

The Documentation Router is set up for the OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.

### API Router

The API Router is set up as a mock RESTful API for consumption, and also for
description by the documentation generated by Swagger UI
